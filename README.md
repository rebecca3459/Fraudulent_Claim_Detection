The objective is to build a data-driven solution that can automatically classify claims as fraudulent or legitimate early in the approval process. Global Insure seeks to develop a predictive model that classifies insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate using historical data—such as claim amounts, customer profiles, and claim types—to identify fraud risk before claims are approved. This data-driven approach will enable proactive fraud detection, reduce financial losses, enhance operational efficiency, and foster a secure, customer-friendly claims process, strengthening the company’s position in the insurance market.
